<h1>Cark's Video Center</h1>
<h2>(Still a work in progress)</h2>
<p>Welcome to Cark's (or Curt's, depending on who you ask) gaming video site! <br>
This site was made out of fustration due to Youtube's annoyance from ads, low bitrate videos, and other minor issues.<br><br>
I still upload to my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwjUzKJeIrPASfnW4SMKbDw" title="Link to my Youtube Channel">Youtube Channel</a> for convenience sake,
 but if you want to best quality for my videos then they can be found here!<br><br>
 
 Included below are some links to get you to the videos that you may be looking for, as well as some other goodies.<br>
 Have fun during your stay and feel free to visit the 'Contact' page with any questions you may have!

<p> <font color="red"> <b> Fair Warning! These videos are very large (0.5-1.5 Gigabytes!) due to their uncompressed nature, and may eat up a lot of your data plan! <br>
 It is not recommended that you watch these videos on a mobile network or a network plan with limited data, as you may burn through a lot of it very quickly!<br><br>
Videos can also be downloaded to be viewed later by right clicking on them or long pressing if you are on mobile! </p>
